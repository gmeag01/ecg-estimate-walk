# Deep Learning Approaches for Estimate Steps from RAW ECG Signals

Our project aims to estimate walking steps from raw electrocardiogram (ECG) signals obtained from wearable devices. The ECG signals collected during walking contain baseline wander, which the project hypothesizes can be converted to signals from an inertia measurement unit (IMU). This approach is relevant to monitoring physical performance during walking, jogging, and running, which are popular leisure activities for people pursuing fitness. Wearable devices with IMUs are commonly used to monitor physical performance during these activities. Additionally, other studies have investigated walking at different speeds and inclines, as well as climbing stairs, to better understand human locomotion.
