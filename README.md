# Deep Learning Approaches for Estimate Steps from RAW ECG Signals

Our project aims to estimate walking steps from raw electrocardiogram (ECG) signals obtained from wearable devices. Wearable devices with IMUs are commonly used to monitor physical performance during these activities. Additionally, other studies have investigated walking at different speeds and inclines, as well as climbing stairs, to better understand human locomotion.
